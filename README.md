# Number Guessing Game Simple Project 1
Create a program that allows the user to play a number-guessing game against the computer.The computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 100.The player will try to guess the number by entering guesses.
After each guess, the program should tell the player whether the guess is:
Too high (ðŸ”½ Lower number please!)
Too low (ðŸ”¼ Higher number please!)
Correct (âœ… Congratulations!).
The program should also display the number of attempts taken by the player once they guess the number correctly.
The game should continue until the correct number is guessed.
